A hazard that slams downward, destroying the player if it is in its path. Perhaps its "AI" will work like this:
- - If there is an immovable widget right above it, it slams down.
- - If there is an immovable widget right under it, it moves up one space.
- - If there neither the spot directly above or below it is blocked, it slams upward, destroying the player if in its path.

Two widgets that work together to create movement.
- - A "puller" widget that moves away from/flees the "pusher" widget.
- - A "pusher" widget that chases the "puller".
- - 
- - Maybe there can be diffrerent types. Like a "smart" puller that, if it can't move forward, will turn and move in
- - another direction, if possible.
- - "Evil" pushers and pullers that hurt the player.
- - 
- - Perhaps pushers and pullers move simultaniously, so that a pusher can move into the exact location that the puller is in.
- - EG:
- - - - - - o = pusher
- - o > - - > = puller
- - - - - -
- -
- - - - - - 
- - - o > - 
- - - - - - 
- - Actually, that might not work, as whether or not two widget move simultaneously depends on the direction they're moving in.
- - Nonethless, a puller and pusher will generally be moving in the same direction.
- - 
- - Or maybe there won't be a dedicated pusher or puller, but rather I just put in 3 or 4 widgets that behave like:
- - - - A: Chases B, flees C
- - - - B: Chases C, flees A
- - - - C: Chases A, flees B
