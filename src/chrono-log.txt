// Kyle and I worked on the move function. We added some conditions to the move function.
//
// We gave the move function a recursion limit. Basically, when the move function is initially called, a 0 will be
// passed into the recursion-counting parameter (recursionCount). From there, if the function will check if the
// recursionCount has reached/exceeded the RECURSION_LIMIT. If so, it stops the function. If the function calls itself, 
// it will increment the recursionCount and then pass that value into the new function call.
// 
// We also added some new char constants, including the coin counter and the jump counter
// (on that note, the "dash" ability has been renamed to the "jump" ability).
// 
// We added two more functions. One, called isMovable, checks if a char is movable. The other, called isDangerous, 
// checks if a certain char is dangerous.
//
// Next week, we plan to continue working on the move function.

// Kyle and I worked on the move function. We added some conditions to the move function.
// Specifically the condition checking if the player is pushing a movable.
//
// Next week we will test out the move function according to the diagram that I made.

Friday July 11 2025:
// Kyle and I tested out the move function. We created the testing ground map, which contains 16 tests.
// All but one passed. The one test that failed:
// The player moves into a dangerous spot (onto an enemy). At that point, the player should disappear
// (be destroyed), and the enemy stays as is. Instead, both the player and the enemy stayed put. Nothing changed.
// The problem? Instead of setting the players position to an empty space, it was checking to see if the
// player's position WAS an empty space.
// I simply removed an '=' sign.
//
// Next time, we will likely work on the jump function.

Got started on the jump function.
Also, potential new names for the jump ability: Warp, blink.
