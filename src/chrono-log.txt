// Kyle and I worked on the move function. We added some conditions to the move function.
//
// We gave the move function a recursion limit. Basically, when the move function is initially called, a 0 will be
// passed into the recursion-counting parameter (recursionCount). From there, if the function will check if the
// recursionCount has reached/exceeded the RECURSION_LIMIT. If so, it stops the funciton. If the function calls itself, 
// it will increment the recursionCount and then pass that value into the new function call.
// 
// We also added some new char constants, including the coin counter and the jump counter
// (on that note, the "dash" ability has been renamed to the "jump" ability).
// 
// We added two more functions. One, called isMovable, checks if a char is movable. The other, called isDangerous, 
// checks if a certain char is dangerous.
//
// Next week, we plan to continue working on the move function.

// Kyle and I worked on the move function. We added some conditions to the move function.
// Specifically the condition checking if the player is pushing a movable.
//
// Next week we will test out the move function according to the diagram that I made.
